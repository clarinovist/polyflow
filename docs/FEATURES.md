## 📦 Product & Inventory Management

### Product Management System

#### 1. **Multi-Variant Product Support**

PolyFlow supports complex product hierarchies with multiple variants per product:

- **Product Level**: High-level categorization (e.g., "Pure PP Granules")
- **Variant Level**: SKU-specific items (e.g., "Pure PP Granules Standard - RM-PP-PURE")

**Product Types**:

- `RAW_MATERIAL` - Incoming materials from suppliers
- `INTERMEDIATE` - Results of mixing/blending processes
- `PACKAGING` - Packaging materials
- `WIP` (Work in Progress) - Semi-finished goods in production
- `FINISHED_GOOD` - Ready-to-sell products
- `SCRAP` - Production waste/recyclable materials

#### 2. **Dual-Unit Management**

Every product variant supports dual-unit tracking:

```typescript
{
  primaryUnit: Unit.KG,           // Internal tracking unit
  salesUnit: Unit.BAL,            // Sales/customer-facing unit
  conversionFactor: 5.0           // 1 BAL = 5 KG
}
```

**Supported Units**:

- `KG` - Kilograms (primary for most materials)
- `ROLL` - Rolls (for film/raffia)
- `BAL` - Bales (packed finished goods)
- `PCS` - Pieces (discrete items)
- `ZAK` - Sacks (bulk packaging)

#### 3. **Advanced Pricing**

Track multiple price points per variant:

- **price**: Base/standard price
- **buyPrice**: Purchase cost (for costing calculations)
- **sellPrice**: Sales price (for invoicing)

#### 4. **SKU Management**

- Unique SKU codes enforced at database level
- Automatic duplicate detection during create/update
- SKU-based product lookup and reporting

#### 5. **Product Attributes**

Store flexible metadata as JSON:

```json
{
  "color": "Red",
  "thickness": "Standard",
  "material": "PP"
}
```

### Inventory Management System

#### 1. **Multi-Location Stock Tracking**

Real-time inventory across multiple locations:

**Seeded Locations**:

- **Raw Material Warehouse** (`rm_warehouse`) - Incoming materials storage
- **Mixing Area** (`mixing_area`) - Production Floor 1
- **Extrusion Area** (`extrusion_area`) - Production Floor 2
- **Finished Goods Warehouse** (`fg_warehouse`) - Ready products
- **Scrap Warehouse** (`scrap_warehouse`) - Waste materials

**Inventory Model**:

```typescript
{
  locationId: string,
  productVariantId: string,
  quantity: Decimal,              // Uses Prisma Decimal for precision
  updatedAt: DateTime             // Auto-updated on changes
}
```

**Composite Unique Key**: `(locationId, productVariantId)` ensures one record per variant-location pair.

#### 2. **Stock Movement Tracking**

Complete audit trail for all inventory changes:

**Movement Types**:

- `IN` - Stock received (from suppliers)
- `OUT` - Stock issued (to customers/production)
- `TRANSFER` - Between locations
- `ADJUSTMENT` - Manual corrections

**Movement Record**:

```typescript
{
  type: MovementType,
  productVariantId: string,
  fromLocationId?: string,        // Source (null for IN)
  toLocationId?: string,          // Destination (null for OUT)
  quantity: Decimal,
  reference?: string,             // Notes/reason
  createdById?: string,           // User who made the change
  createdAt: DateTime
}
```

#### 3. **Low Stock Alerts**

Dynamic threshold tracking:

- Set `minStockAlert` per product variant
- Dashboard calculates total quantity across all locations
- Alerts trigger when `totalQuantity < minStockAlert`
- Configurable thresholds via UI dialog

**Dashboard Low Stock Card**:

```typescript
{
  lowStockCount: number,          // Count of variants below threshold
  alert: boolean                  // Visual alert flag
}
```

#### 4. **Stock Transfer Operations**

Move inventory between locations with atomic transactions:

**Validation**:

- ✅ Source location has sufficient stock
- ✅ Source quantity >= transfer quantity
- ✅ Transaction rolls back on any error

**Process**:

1. Validate source stock
2. Decrement source inventory
3. Increment (or upsert) destination inventory
4. Create TRANSFER movement record
5. Commit transaction

**Example**:

```typescript
await transferStock({
  sourceLocationId: "rm_warehouse",
  destinationLocationId: "mixing_area",
  productVariantId: "RM-PP-PURE",
  quantity: 100,
  notes: "For production batch #123",
  date: new Date(),
});
```

#### 5. **Stock Adjustment**

Manual inventory corrections:

**Adjustment Types**:

- `ADJUSTMENT_IN` - Increase stock (e.g., found inventory, corrections)
- `ADJUSTMENT_OUT` - Decrease stock (e.g., damaged goods, corrections)

**Validation**:

- ✅ OUT adjustments check for sufficient stock
- ✅ IN adjustments can create new inventory records (upsert)

**Movement Record Direction**:

- IN: `fromLocationId: null`, `toLocationId: locationId`
- OUT: `fromLocationId: locationId`, `toLocationId: null`

#### 6. **Inventory Dashboard**

Real-time inventory view with filtering:

**Features**:

- Filter by location
- Filter by product type
- Low-stock highlighting (yellow background)
- Stock quantity with unit labels
- Last updated timestamp
- Quick threshold adjustment dialog
- **NEW**: Reserved and Available stock columns
- **NEW**: Calculated available stock (Total - Reserved)

**Table Columns**:

- Product name
- SKU code
- Location
- Product type
- Current quantity (with unit)
- Reserved quantity
- Available quantity
- Min stock alert
- Low stock indicator

---

### Stock Opname (Physical Inventory Count)

Periodic physical stock verification workflow:

#### 1. **Stock Opname Process**

**Workflow**:

1. Create new opname session (select location, date)
2. System generates count sheet with expected quantities
3. Warehouse staff performs physical count
4. Enter counted quantities via Counter interface
5. System calculates variances automatically
6. Manager reviews and approves/rejects
7. Auto-generate adjustment movements for approved variances

#### 2. **Opname Model**

```typescript
{
  id: string,
  opnameNumber: string,           // Auto-generated reference
  locationId: string,
  status: OpnameStatus,           // DRAFT, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
  countDate: DateTime,
  items: OpnameItem[],
  notes?: string,
  createdById: string
}
```

#### 3. **UI Components**

- **Opname List**: View all opname sessions with status filters
- **Opname Create Dialog**: Start new opname with location selection
- **Opname Detail**: View items with variances highlighted
- **Opname Counter**: Mobile-friendly counting interface with sticky save button

---

### Bill of Materials (BOM)

Production recipe management:

#### 1. **BOM Structure**

```typescript
{
  name: "Standard Mixing Recipe - Red",
  productVariantId: "INT-MIX-RED",       // Output product
  outputQuantity: 100,                   // Basis quantity (e.g., 100 KG)
  isDefault: true,                       // Active recipe flag
  items: [
    {
      productVariantId: "RM-PP-PURE",    // Input ingredient
      quantity: 98,                      // Required quantity
      scrapPercentage: 1.0               // Expected waste %
    },
    {
      productVariantId: "RM-COLOR-RED",
      quantity: 2
    }
  ]
}
}

#### 2. **Duplicate BOM (Salin Formula)**
Copy an existing recipe to a new product variant with optional quantity scaling:

- **Entry point:** "Duplikat Formula" menu in BOM list actions / detail page button
- **Scale factor:** Multiply all ingredient quantities by a scale (e.g., 0.9 = 90%)
- **Scrap %:** Preserved unchanged from source
- **Default handling:** Automatically unsets previous default BOM on target variant
- **Audit:** Logged as `DUPLICATE_BOM` with source + scale details

#### 3. **Production Cycle Example**

**Stage 1: Mixing**

- Input: 98 KG Pure PP + 2 KG Red Colorant
- Output: 100 KG Red Mixed Granules (INTERMEDIATE)
- Scrap: 1% expected (0.98 KG)

**Stage 2: Extrusion**

- Input: 100 KG Red Mixed Granules
- Output: 100 KG Red Raffia Jumbo Roll (WIP)
- Scrap: 2% expected (2 KG)

**Stage 3: Converting**

- Input: WIP Roll
- Output: Finished Red Raffia Bales (FINISHED_GOOD)
- Unit: BAL (1 BAL = 5 KG)

### Machine Master Data

Track production equipment:

#### **Machine Model**

```typescript
{
  name: "Mixer Turbo 01",
  code: "MIX-01",                       // Unique machine code
  type: MachineType.MIXER,              // Equipment type
  locationId: "mixing_area",            // Associated location

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Server Actions

All data mutations use Next.js 16 Server Actions:

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Type-safe client-server communication
- ✅ Automatic API route generation
- ✅ Built-in error handling
- ✅ Progressive enhancement

**Validation**:
All inputs validated using **Zod** schemas:

```typescript
import { z } from "zod";

export const transferStockSchema = z.object({
  sourceLocationId: z.string().min(1),
  destinationLocationId: z.string().min(1),
  productVariantId: z.string().min(1),
  quantity: z.number().positive(),
  notes: z.string().optional(),
  date: z.date(),
});
```

### Database Transactions

Critical operations use Prisma transactions for atomicity:

```typescript
await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Validate
  const sourceStock = await tx.inventory.findUnique(...);

  // 2. Decrement source
  await tx.inventory.update(...);

  // 3. Increment destination
  await tx.inventory.upsert(...);

  // 4. Log movement
  await tx.stockMovement.create(...);
});
```

**Benefits**:

- ✅ All-or-nothing commits
- ✅ Data consistency guaranteed
- ✅ Automatic rollback on error

### Real-Time Updates

Use Next.js `revalidatePath()` for cache invalidation:

```typescript
revalidatePath("/dashboard/inventory");
revalidatePath("/dashboard/inventory/history");
```

This ensures UI reflects latest data without full page reload.
