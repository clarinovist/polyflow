# PolyFlow ERP System 🏭

**Modern ERP for Plastic Converting Manufacturing**

PolyFlow is a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system specifically designed for plastic converting and manufacturing operations. Built with **Next.js 16**, **Prisma**, and **PostgreSQL**, it provides real-time inventory management, production tracking, and multi-location stock control.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**PolyFlow** streamlines the complete plastic manufacturing workflow—from raw materials through mixing, extrusion, and finishing—to final goods distribution. The system features a modern, multi-portal architecture:

- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive management of products, inventory, and analytics.
- **Finance Dashboard**: Specialized workspace for accounting, invoicing, and cost reporting.
- **Operator Kiosk Portal**: Simplified, touch-friendly interface for production floor execution.
- **Warehouse Portal**: Focused material fulfillment queue for warehouse staff.

The system handles:

- **Multi-location inventory tracking** across warehouse and production floors
- **Complex product variants** with dual-unit management (KG, ROLL, BAL, PCS, ZAK)
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)** for production recipes and mixing formulas
- **Stock movements** with full audit trail (transfers, adjustments, in/out)
- **Machine master data** for production floor tracking
- **Real-time dashboard** with low-stock alerts and movement history
